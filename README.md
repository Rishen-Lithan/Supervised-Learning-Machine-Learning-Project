# Iris Dataset - Machine Learning Classification

This repository contains the source code and notebooks for a machine learning assignment using the **Iris dataset**. The objective of this project is to classify iris flower species using supervised learning algorithms.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Name:** Iris Dataset  
- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)

The dataset includes 150 samples with 4 features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

Each sample belongs to one of three species: *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, or *Virginica*.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

Three supervised learning algorithms were applied:
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

## 📊 Evaluation

Each model was trained and evaluated using accuracy and classification metrics. Comparisons are made based on performance across all three models.
